# Why the weird use of null defaults? This module is a "child" used by the terraform-provider-helm parent module.
# Since we don't want to duplicate default managemant, some hacky use of locals and ternary operators are necessary.
# As such, the defaults are configured in the locals{} block in this module's corresponding main.tf file.
# See this issue for more details https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/24142
